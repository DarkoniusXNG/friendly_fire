# Friendly Fire Dota 2 custom game
Dota 2 where every ability has an interaction with allies and enemies. If the ability can target enemies it can target allies too and vice versa. If the ability can damage enemies, it can damage allies too and vice versa. This is not true in some cases:

1) Abilities that already have some interaction with both teams like Pudge Meat Hook and Abaddon Myst Coil are not changed in any way.
2) Abilities with attack modifiers are not changed in any way, they mostly don't work on allies.

List of abilities that don't work on allies:
* Abaddon Curse of Avernus (doesn't slow them)
* Alchemist Greevil's Greed (you don't gain gold when denying)
* Ancient Apparition Ice Blast (it works only when you are near them upon launch)
* Anti-Mage Mana Break
* Bristleback AoE Nasal Goo (with Aghanim Scepter)
* Doom Infernal Blade
* Huskar Burning Spear
* Luna Eclipse
* Viper Poison Attack

List of abilities that don't work on enemies:
* Centaur Warruner Stampede
* Chen Hand of God
* Dark Seer AoE Surge (with talent)
* Dazzle AoE Shallow Grave (with Aghanim Scepter)
* Mirana Moonlight Shadow
