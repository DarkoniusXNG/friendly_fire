# Friendly Fire Dota 2 custom game
Dota 2 where every ability has an interaction with allies and enemies. If the ability can target enemies it can target allies too and vice versa. If the ability can damage enemies, it can damage allies too and vice versa. This is not true in some cases:

1) Abilities that already have some interaction with both teams like Pudge Meat Hook and Abaddon Myst Coil are not changed in any way.
2) Abilities with attack modifiers are not changed in any way, they mostly don't work on allies (haven't tested all).

Hero progress:

* Abaddon - 99% - needs explanations in tooltips
* Alchemist - 100%
* Anti-Mage - 99% - needs explanations in tooltips
* Chaos Knight - 100%
* Disruptor - 75% - needs reimplemented Static Storm
* Sven - 100%
